337418,Cholesterol Lowdown,The Good and Misunderstood,"When you were younger, you might have heard your parents or grandparents complaining about cholesterol, and decided \""cholesterol = not good.\"" \n\nBut cholesterol gets a bit of a bad rap. \n\nKnown to sciency people as a _lipid_, cholesterol is a fatty acid that makes up parts of your body. Maybe you’ve heard that there are two types of cholesterol:\n\n* Good cholesterol&mdash;called HDL, for high-density lipoprotein\n* Bad cholesterol&mdash;called LDL, for low-density lipoprotein\n\nBut did you know that&mdash;for the most part&mdash;they’re _both_ important for your well-being? \n\nYour body depends on LDL and HDL cholesterol to build tissue and produce hormones, along with other vital functions. Cholesterol is also a key component in cardiovascular health and aging. That’s why checking your cholesterol levels and getting them to a healthy range should factor high on your to-do list.  \n\n",116.0,S,1,Article
337418,Cholesterol Lowdown,Cholesterol Confusion,"Get LDL and HDL mixed up? You’re not the only one. The following details highlight the main differences, so you’ll be able to have a more coherent cholesterol conversation with your doctor:\n\n\n### LDL\nLDL&mdash;the \""bad\"" cholesterol&mdash;travels from your liver to your cells for storage, but sometimes bits of cholesterol fall off along the way. Over time, these dropped fragments collect in your arteries and harden into plaque, a condition known as atherosclerosis. The more LDL in your blood, the more plaque—which we don't have to tell you is bad.\n\nOne component of LDL&mdash;a protein called _Apolipoprotein B_ (ApoB)&mdash;helps carry cholesterol and fat through your blood. A study from The American Association for Clinical Chemistry found that since ApoB is linked to LDL and not HDL, it might be an even more obvious sign of unhealthy cholesterol levels than LDL alone. Sounds like a pretty good reason to keep your eye on both LDL and ApoB.\n\n### HDL\nHDL&mdash;the \""good\"" cholesterol&mdash;is linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Moving in the opposite direction of LDL, it takes cholesterol away from your cells and arteries to your liver for processing. It's also a tidy traveler that doesn't drop anything on the way&mdash;helping to keep your arteries clear. \n\nCare for a handy trick to help you remember the two? The L in LDL can stand for \""lousy\"" and the H in HDL can stand for \""healthy.\""\n\nHere’s an interesting fact most people don’t realize: your liver already produces ALL the cholesterol you could possibly require. It converts it from other nutrients&mdash;but you also get it in the food you eat, which can add too much. When there’s too much cholesterol&mdash;specifically LDL&mdash;problems like coronary heart disease and stroke can arise.\n\nLater on, we promise to share some Reboot tips for keeping that cholesterol in a happy, healthy place. But first, we bet you want to know more about the benefits of healthy cholesterol&mdash;and how it can help you reclaim your prime years.   \n\n",116.0,S,1,Article
337419,Control Cholesterol,Lower to Live longer,"It’s no secret that cholesterol can have a _huge_ impact on your heart and vascular system. All of us at Reboot Your Age are an informed bunch, so you probably already know that millions of Americans suffer from cardiovascular disease every year.\n\nHowever, taking the right steps (we’ll share those next) toward healthy cholesterol levels can put you on the path to: \n\n* Reduced rates of coronary heart disease\n* Fewer heart attacks and strokes\n* Less incidence of vascular disease and circulation disorders     \n\nThe main culprit for these conditions is&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;high LDL levels. As we previously mentioned, when this type of cholesterol builds up in the arteries, it hardens into plaque, which restricts blood flow. HDL comes along and tries to clean up the mess, but if HDL levels aren’t high enough, it can't do the most effective job. \n\nThis hardening of the arteries&mdash;_atherosclerosis_&mdash;it’s something you definitely want to avoid. \n\nBut no need to be dis&mdash;_heartened_ (see what we did there?). Luckily, the Framingham Study&mdash;the longest&mdash;running heart study in the U.S.&mdash;says you can significantly improve your chance of avoiding future cardiovascular events. You just have to get your LDL levels down to 70 mg/dL and your HDL to a little above 50 mg/dL. \n\nThe great news is that lowering your LDL has also been linked to improving outcomes related to blood pressure, and the measurement known as body mass index (BMI). And if you are between 55 and 65, lowering your LDL by just 11 mg/dL can decrease the risk of coronary heart disease by 25%.\n\n",117.0,S,1,Article
337419,Control Cholesterol,The Younger You!,"Now the question you’ve been patiently waiting to ask: \""How much can lowering my cholesterol improve my Reboot Age?\""\n\nWell, at age 60 both men and women can make their Reboot Age five months younger for _every 25 mg/dL_ their LDL cholesterol decreases towards 70 mg/dL. And at age 70, men made their Reboot Age almost six months younger for _every 25 mg/dL decrease_, while women aged 70 stayed at five months younger. Just think, by getting your LDL to a healthier range, you can make your Reboot age almost six months younger each time you go down by 25 mg/dL. \n\nSo, how can you achieve healthy cholesterol levels— and make your Reboot Age younger? Coming up, we’ll walk you through how to whip your cholesterol into shape to get it working in your favor.\n\n",117.0,S,1,Article

337420,Happy Cholesterol,Grill Your Cholesterol,##### Are LDL and HDL cholesterol both bad for you?,118.0,S,4,Quiz
337420,Happy Cholesterol,LOL at Your LDL,"Getting optimal cholesterol levels is pretty straightforward—almost as easy as picking up dinner through a fast-food drive-through, and definitely healthier. \nLucky for you, we've parsed some steps to improve your cholesterol that are way simpler to navigate than programming your GPS to find the fastest route to said fast-food joint.\n\n**Measure it**\n\nPart of staying healthy—and being younger longer—is regularly testing your LDL, HDL, and ApoB levels. Many cardiovascular events don't present symptoms ahead of time. That's why asking your doctor to measure your cholesterol levels can be a proactive way to avoid future problems. When doing a lipid panel to test cholesterol, be aware that your doctor may ask you to fast for 12 hours beforehand. \n\nSet your goal levels as follows:\n* LDL below 70 mg/dL\n* HDL above 50 mg/dL\n* ApoB below 80 mg/dL\n\n**Avoid it**\n\nIt should be no surprise that diet can play a big role in managing your cholesterol. Like most things concerning your health, what you eat matters. Studies show that your diet has a big impact on bad cholesterol levels. One study even showed that a single serving of Brazil nuts will significantly lower your LDL. That's nuts! To reduce LDL and ApoB levels, you can lower your intake of:\n* Trans/saturated fats—often found in processed foods, fried food, meats, and dairy \n* Sugar and added syrups—like in sugary drinks and candy\n* Simple carbohydrates—sorry but that means white bread, white pasta, cookies, etc. \n\nWe know it's hard to do, but we recommend lowering fats to less than 30% of your daily diet—with less than 10% coming from saturated fats—and consuming less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. You can usually find handy guides with fat and cholesterol levels on food labels for guidance. \nAnd remember, your liver produces enough cholesterol for your body already, so even decreasing your LDL levels by 5% could take you from problem cholesterol to manageable cholesterol.\n\n**Burn it**\n\nExercise combined with diet is a proven way to lower both LDL and ApoB. And you'll be thrilled to hear that even minimal exercise can help get your HDL to that healthy zone. Actually, a study from Ochanomizu University in Tokyo, Japan, found that if you get your heart pumping for just 30 minutes, three times a week, you can achieve a significant increase in HDL *regardless of diet.* \n\nAs an extra bonus, exercise is a key to managing stress—which can also reduce cardiovascular risk. \n\nSo be sure to get in some form of aerobic or pulse-increasing activity three times a week to help keep your cholesterol and cardiovascular health on point.\n\n",118.0,S,1,Article
337420,Happy Cholesterol,Next Steps,"Follow these simple steps to achieve healthy cholesterol levels. And, be aware that you can do all the right things and still have an issue with cholesterol levels—it might be in your genes. Everyone's different and sometimes you need a little help. There's zero shame in that.\n\nIf diet and exercise aren't working, speak to your doctor about hereditary factors and medications that can help you manage cholesterol levels. \n\nThere you go! Newly equipped with some cholesterol-controlling tips for your Reboot journey, you've already made another step toward being a younger you.\n\n",118.0,S,2,Article

337424,To BMI or Not to BMI,Put Less Weight on BMI,"BMI. You’ve either read about it, worried about it, or had it measured in your doctor’s office. But what exactly is it? \n\nBMI is the ratio of your body weight to your height. \n\nBasically, your BMI—or body mass index—is a quick way to assess how much excess fat is on your body. \n\nAccording to a study carried out by the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka, BMI and body fat percentage tend to correlate. Which means, generally, the higher your BMI, the higher your ratio of body fat. And the higher your ratio of body fat, the more likely you are to develop health issues down the line. \n\nHowever, BMI isn’t actually all that accurate when it comes to judging overall health. \n\nMuscle mass and fat mass have very different effects on the body, yet BMI doesn’t differentiate between the two. So—as an example—when Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his bodybuilding career, his BMI was 33. According to the BMI scale, he was *obese*. Same goes for Dwayne \""The Rock\"" Johnson, who has a BMI of just over 34. \n\nWe think it’s safe to say neither one of these (extremely healthy) men is obese.  \n\nBMI’s other big flaw is that not all fat is equal. Case in point: visceral fat and gluteofemoral fat. Visceral fat—abdominal adipose tissue—is much more harmful than gluteofemoral fat—adipose tissue distributed around the buttocks and thighs. \n\nIn other words, it’s possible to have a high BMI without having the kind of fat that’s bad for your health. \n\n",121.0,S,1,Article
337424,To BMI or Not to BMI,A Better Approach,"A much better measure of overall health is the waist-to-height ratio. \n\n\""What’s the waist-to-height ratio?\"", you ask. \n\nWell, it’s the circumference of your waist divided by your height. It’s a way more accurate measure of the amount of visceral fat on your body. Because of this, the waist-to-height ratio is the best predictor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality—both of which are linked to high levels of visceral fat. \n\nSo, is BMI really the best predictor of overall health? Not really. \n\nIt’s good in a pinch—let’s face it, most of us aren’t professional bodybuilders—but waist-to-height ratio is a lot more accurate.\n\nWhen it comes to your overall health, your body’s fat distribution is just as important as the numbers you see on the scale.\n\n",121.0,S,2,Article
337425,Measure Up!,The Case for Waist-to-Height,"As we’ve mentioned, the BMI ratio *is not* an infallible measure of body fat. A more precise assessment is the waist-to-height ratio, which is the measure of the circumference of your waist at your belly button *divided* by your height in inches. \n\nThe waist-to-height ratio is also a more accurate determinant of cardiovascular health and mortality. That’s why we’ll be using these values for the rest of your Reboot journey. \n\nWith this assessment, men are healthiest when they fall between 0.43 and 0.52, or have a waist that’s less than 39 inches. Meanwhile, women are healthiest between 0.42 and 0.48, or have a waist that’s less than 37 inches (sans shapewear). \n\nAnd in case you were wondering, there isn’t a specific numerical value for obesity using the waist-to-height ratio. But you may be interested in the wholistic definition of obesity from The Obesity Medicine Association:\n\n*Chronic, relapsing, multi-factorial, neurobehavioral disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences.*\n\nOr, if you don’t speak fluent science geek, simply put: Obesity is a complex disease that affects your physical, psychological, and social well-being. Note: If you’re obese and all lifestyle changes have failed, you may want to discuss the risks and benefits of weight loss surgery—also known as bariatric surgery—with your doctor. \n\n",122.0,S,1,Article
337425,Measure Up!,Whittle Your Middle,"Excess fat—specifically belly (or visceral) fat—is bad news for your wellbeing.

You should know that having excess fat is not a moral or personal failing. So don’t you dare punish yourself for having excess fat. \n\nInstead, take the approach you'd want someone who loves you to take: gently encourage yourself to make some lifestyle changes. \n\n\n**First Step— Making Mindful Food Choices**\n\nThis is *your* Reboot journey. You need to find what works for you. We offer you lots of guidance on food and exercise - two of The 5 Pillars that are important for your overall health, wellbeing and longevity.\n\nIf you’re looking to get started losing excess fat, we suggest you first steer clear of these \""No Foods,\"" as you’ve heard Dr. Mike call them:\n\n\n**5 Food Felons**\n\n\n* Simple sugars \n* Added syrups \n* Simple or stripped carbs \n* Foods with saturated or trans fats\n* Fried foods\n\n**5 Food Favorites**\n\nWe're sure you remember from the lesson on blood pressure that it’s best to include unprocessed, whole foods into your diet, like:\n\n\n* Legumes\n* Oats\n* Fruits\n* Veggies\n* Salmon\n\n\nSimple substitutions—instead of all-out restrictions—won’t feel like you’re missing out on too much. For example, you can switch out your midday sugary soda for seltzer water with some diced up fruit, or a squeeze of fresh lime juice and a sprig of mint. Or eat some fruit—which is high in fiber—instead of drinking a glass of overly-processed fruit juice. Small changes can make all the difference. \n\nAnd for next steps in healthier eating, we’re big fans of IMF!\n\n\n**Intermittent Fasting**\n\n\nWe’ll go in-depth on this topic soon, but for now here's the skinny on IMF. \n\nIntermittent fasting is not a diet, it’s a cycle of eating and fasting. \n\nBasically, with intermittent fasting, you choose a certain number of hours in the day to eat—only when the sun is up, of course—and spend the rest of your day fasting. This can boost your body’s ability to burn fat. Yes, please!\n\nAlso, aim to eat 75% of your daily calories at least seven hours before going to bed. In other words, try to eat larger meals earlier in the day and smaller meals later on. \n\n",124.0,S,1,Article

We'll get to that a bit later in your Reboot journey. First, let's take a look at what Aspirin is and how it works.\n",130.0,S,1,Article
337434,The ABCs of ASA,ASA What?,"Aspirin or ASA (*acetylsalicylic acid*) is a medication that's usually recommended by doctors depending on factors like your age and medical status. But did you know it's been used—in evolving forms—for over 3,500 years? \n\nIt was first used by ancient humans in Egypt, Sumeria, Greece, and Rome—via willow bark—to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. \n\nWillow bark contains a substance known as *salicin*, which turns into active, pharmacological *salicylic acid* once metabolized in the body. In 1897 the chemist Flix Hoffman chemically synthesized salicylic acid— and boom—aspirin was born!",130.0,S,2,Article
337434,The ABCs of ASA,ASA How?,"Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or—as you've likely heard—*NSAID*. It works by quickly absorbing into the stomach or small intestine.\n\nIn low doses, aspirin is able to stop blood platelets from forming and/or grouping—so it prevents clotting. It does this by blocking enzymes known as *cyclooxygenase* (COX) from forming. COX enzymes convert into a potent blood clotting lipid called *thromboxane*—which is exactly where the term thrombosis comes from.   \n\nWhile blood clotting is essential to wound healing, blood that clots slower has less chance of sticking to plaques in arteries and/or becoming a blood clot. ASA reduces your platelet level until more are produced in a day or so.\n\nIn higher and more frequent doses, ASA is used to treat pain and swelling because of its anti-inflammatory properties that limit *prostaglandin*, the chemical that causes inflammation.\n\nAspirin is unique from other NSAIDS because it's able to inhibit more than one COX enzyme at a time, which means it has the power to reduce inflammation while also limiting platelet buildup. \n\nOne other area we find of growing interest is the research into aspirin's potential to prevent cancer. A study from Ohio State University found that—due to the functions of aspirin listed above—the risk of developing certain cancers was reduced by almost 25% after 3 years of taking daily aspirin.\n",130.0,S,3,Article

337437,An Aspirin a Day,May Keep Woes at Bay,"ASA is a hot commodity in the world of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular medicine. It's typically used in two ways: *primary prevention* and *secondary prevention*. \n\nPrimary prevention means that you've never had a vascular disease—or event—and you're taking ASA to help prevent a possible future issue from occurring. \n\nSecondary prevention means you've already suffered a vascular event—or have a known disease or problem. Your goal with ASA is to keep any future issues at bay.\n\nBecause of its antiplatelet properties, ASA is a milestone in preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. These benefits are seen in low ASA doses at 81 mg once or twice a day. \n\nYou already know that ASA can help reduce blood clotting, heart attack, and stroke, but growing evidence hints at other ways taking a daily dose may help you out.\n",133.0,S,1,Article
337437,An Aspirin a Day,Decrease Cancer Risk,"As we mentioned in the first lesson on Aspirin, American studies have found that ASA may play a role in preventing cancer. Researchers also found that daily aspirin may have a significant effect in reducing the risk of existing cancer spreading to other sites. \n\nDaily ASA was linked to a decrease in:\n \n- Esophageal cancer by 73% \n- Colon cancer by 63%\n- Stomach cancer by 62%\n- Ovarian cancer by 47% \n- Breast and prostate cancers by 39% \n- Lung cancer by 36%\n",133.0,S,2,Article
337437,An Aspirin a Day,Aid Inflammation,"As we explained before, aspirin in higher doses has the ability to block the COX-2 enzyme that is linked to pain and inflammation. And while temporary inflammation is needed for the healing process, chronic inflammation caused by inflammatory conditions is not.\n\nIn a 2010 study from London, research showed that even taking a daily lower dose of aspirin has been successful in limiting inflammation related to acute and chronic conditions.\n",133.0,S,3,Article
337437,An Aspirin a Day,Aid Cognitive Function,"One study from Sweden found that users of high-dose aspirin had significantly lower instances of dementia and Alzheimer's—by up to 49% less—and that they had better cognitive function.\n\nBut another report from China on aspirin cohort studies found that low-dose aspirin was more likely to reduce dementia and improve cognitive function—though they also stated that the evidence was not enough to give a crystal-clear outcome on aspirin's cognitive effects.\n\nAnd in a different study from Australia, ASA was even linked to helping mental health issues.\n",133.0,S,4,Article
337437,An Aspirin a Day,Increase Longevity,"At long(gevity) last. We made you wait for this one.\n\nIf you factor in all the above ways that ASA may benefit you—less cardiovascular risk, less inflammation, less cancer, improved cognitive function—you're looking at a path to better overall health and greater longevity.\n \nBut before you get excited and start popping aspirin like mints from your grandma's purse, we caution you to keep in mind that—like all medications—you should *always* talk to your doctor and understand the risks.\n\nASA may be a common med, but it's also a powerful one. Dosage matters depending on what it's being used for, and it also comes with the downside of possibly causing gastric and/or cerebral bleeding if not taken correctly.\n\nTomorrow, we will cover our Dr. Mike-approved recommendations for aspirin and give you a Reboot Age.\n",133.0,S,5,Article
